# Module System

## What is this repo?

This is a module system for reducing apparent complexity in backend projects by
providing a method for starting all the different parts of your system, and
passing dependencies between them.

## How to use

See `./examples`. Proper docs coming soonâ„¢

## Speed

Module sorting is (ðŸ”¥ Blazinglyâ„¢) fast, with the sytem being capable of sorting
100 modules with 30 dependencies each in under half a millisecond.

> Run `deno bench` in the project repo to verify these results
